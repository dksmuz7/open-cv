# <p align = "center">ROI based image editing</p>
A simple photo editing using programming with the OpenCV library and Python.

Image 2 is place over the image 1 after removing background of the image 2.

I have used thresholding technique for removing the background of the image 2.

Steps are clearly mentioned in the code.
